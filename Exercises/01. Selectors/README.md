# Exercise 1 - Selectors

## Overview
In this exercise we will practice using various CSS Selectors. Specifically we will use: 
* Basic Selectors (Type, Class, Id, Universal)
* Attribute Selectors
* Combinators
* Pseudo Selectors (Structural, State)
* Pseudo Element Selectors (Before and After)

## Getting Started
* Create a new project and download the [index.html](index.html) file.
* Add a `selectors.css` file to your project.
* Add a `<link>` tag to the `html` file to link it to the `CSS` file you have created


## Steps
Style the HTML elements according to the following instructions. 

~~~ 
DO NOT ALTER THE EXISTING HTML TO DO THIS.  WRITE ONLY CSS! 
~~~

1. Give the `<body>` element a background of `#bdc3c7`


/* Make the <h1> element #9b59b6*/


/* Make all <h2> elements orange */


/* Make all <li> elements blue(pick your own hexadecimal blue)*/ 


/*Change the background on every paragraph to be yellow*/


/*Make all inputs have a 3px red border*/


/* Give everything with the class 'hello' a white background*/


/* Give the element with id 'special' a 2px solid blue border(pick your own rgb blue)*/


/*Make all the <p>'s that are nested inside of divs 25px font(font-size: 25px)*/


/*Make only inputs with type 'text' have a gray background*/


/* Give both <p>'s inside the 3rd <div> a pink background*/


/* Give the 2nd <p> inside the 3rd <div> a 5px white border*/


/* Make the <em> in the 3rd <div> element white and 20px font(font-size:20px)*/



/*BONUS CHALLENGES*/
/*You may need to research some other selectors and properties*/

/*Make all "checked" checkboxes have a left margin of 50px(margin-left: 50px)*/


/* Make the <label> elements all UPPERCASE without changing the HTML(definitely look this one up*/


/*Make the first letter of the element with id 'special' green and 100px font size(font-size: 100)*/


/*Make the <h1> element's color change to blue when hovered over */


/*Make the <a> element's that have been visited gray */
