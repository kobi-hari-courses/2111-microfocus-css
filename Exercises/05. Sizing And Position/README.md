2. in `2.html` you have a page that looks like this:<br> ![problem](images/2.1.png)<br> Make the required changes to make it look like this: <br>![solution](images/2.2.png)
But notice that when ther is not enough space, they need to wrap in the following way:
![solution](images/2.3.png)<br>
![solution](images/2.4.png)<br>
![solution](images/2.5.png)<br>
